# Project CountdownTimer

This project was created initially as a countdouwn timer to "Bag Day" for the FIRST Robotics competition.

Since then, "Bag Day" has been eliminated from the rules and this project has morphed in to a clock, scrolling banner, Game of Life board and more to come.


## Hardware Used

Arduino Uno board

DS1307 Real time clock

Sure 3208 LED Dot Matrix Display (HW Version 2)

## Configuration

Two LED Matrix boards were wired sequentially to create an 8x64 LED display.
